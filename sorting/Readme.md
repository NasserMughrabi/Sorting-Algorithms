- merge and partition methods/functions is most important about the two sorting algorithms (merge and quick)

- The idea of recursion is that instead of conquering the problem top to bottom for graph/tree or start to end for array/string in normal for/while loops, in recursion you conquer the problem from bottom to top (what's before the recursive call(s) gets executed going top to bottom for graph/tree or start to end for array/string and what's after the recursive call(s) gets executed going bottom to top for graph/tree or end to start for array/string). In short, in recursion you conquer the problem from bottom to top. What's before the recursive call(s) gets executed going top to bottom and what's after the recursive call(s) gets executed going bottom to top
